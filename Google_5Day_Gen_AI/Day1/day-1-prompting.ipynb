You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

The sunbeam he usually basked in had shifted, leaving him in the shadow of a dusty windowsill. He'd chased the last of the dust bunnies under the couch, and the postman was on his lunch break. Life, Bartholomew decided, was a snoozefest.\n\nHe decided to take matters into his own paws. With a graceful leap, he landed on the windowsill, his emerald eyes scanning the vibrant world beyond. A particularly enticing scent wafted in - a mix of fresh earth and…was that…pizza? Bartholomew's whiskers twitched with excitement.\n\nHis human, a kindly woman named Agnes, was preoccupied with her knitting. \"Agnes,\" Bartholomew meowed, \"I shall embark on a quest! An adventure! A...journey for pizza!\"\n\nAgnes, oblivious, merely smiled and patted his head. \"Oh, Bartholomew, you're such a silly kitty,\" she said, unaware of the epic adventure her feline companion was about to undertake.\n\nWith a silent purr of anticipation, Bartholomew slipped out the open window and into the world. His paws landed on the dewy grass, the scent of pizza even stronger now. He followed his nose, dodging startled birds and grumpy squirrels, until he reached the source: a bustling street fair, a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds.\n\nThe scent of pizza was intoxicating. It came from a small, brightly-colored food stand. Bartholomew, despite his size, felt a surge of courage. He squeezed through a gap in the crowd, dodging a vendor's feet and a child's outstretched hand. He reached the stand, his eyes fixed on the glorious, cheesy pizza slices.\n\nBut the pizza was guarded by a hulking dog, a Great Dane with a frown that could curdle milk. Bartholomew, feeling a pang of fear, began to retreat. But then, a small, soft voice piped up. \"He's just hungry, Mr. Bigglesworth. He wants pizza.\"\n\nA young girl, no older than ten, with a warm smile and a basket of balloons, was watching him. She gently placed a slice of pizza on the ground, her eyes sparkling with understanding.\n\nBartholomew, overcome with gratitude, gratefully devoured the pizza. The little girl, with a twinkle in her eye, offered him a balloon. He accepted, feeling a surge of joy. It was red, just like his fur.\n\nThe Great Dane, apparently swayed by the girl's kindness and the sight of Bartholomew enjoying the pizza, wagged his tail and lowered his head, offering a friendly lick. Bartholomew, feeling a newfound sense of camaraderie, purred and rubbed his head against the dog's snout.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the fair, Bartholomew, his belly full and his heart happy, decided it was time to return home. He knew, with a certainty that filled him with warmth, that he had discovered something even more valuable than pizza – the joy of friendship and the magic of unexpected adventures.\n\nHe leaped back onto the windowsill, leaving a trail of red balloon string behind him, a reminder of his extraordinary day. Agnes, looking up from her knitting, smiled. \"Bartholomew, where have you been? You're quite the adventurer, aren't you?\"\n\nBartholomew purred softly, his emerald eyes gleaming with the secrets of a thousand adventures. He knew, in his feline heart, that this was just the beginning. The world, with its endless possibilities, was now his oyster.

It enhances your command-line experience by displaying information about the current Git branch, status, and other useful details. \n\nHere's a breakdown of its functionality:\n\n* **Customization:** The script allows you to configure the prompt's appearance using various options. You can set colors, symbols, and the information you want displayed. \n* **Git Status:** The script integrates with Git to fetch the current branch, status (clean, staged, changed, untracked files, etc.), and even information about upstream branches. \n* **Virtual Environments:** The script can integrate with virtual environments (like virtualenv, conda, or Node.js) to display their names in the prompt. \n* **User-Defined Themes:** You can define your own custom themes for the prompt using a `.git-prompt-colors.sh` file in your home directory.\n* **Integration:**  The script modifies the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable to execute the prompt update logic before every command prompt. \n\n**Why would you use it?**\n\n* **Enhanced Git Awareness:** Makes it easier to track your Git branch, status, and upstream changes without constantly running `git status`. \n* **Improved Workflow:**  The prompt acts as a visual indicator of your Git environment, which can make you more aware of changes and potential issues.\n* **Visual Customization:** Allows you to customize the appearance of your command-line prompt with colors and symbols to match your preferences.\n\n**Essentially, it turns your boring Bash prompt into a more informative and visually appealing one, tailored specifically for working with Git.**\n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}}]}
